# Data-Science-Portfolio
This repository is a compilation of data science notebooks I created for self-learning purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/JuanFargier/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Titanic.ipynb) is a competition from Kaggle and it's a binary classification problem. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model for classifying new passengers as to whether they survived the tragedy or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

This project includes examples of Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Machine Learning Algorithms for classification (logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, among others), etc. using Python and its libraries.


## House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

[House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://github.com/JuanFargier/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/House_Prices.ipynb) is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a regression problem: based on 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa we apply different regression algorithms to predict their sale price. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The dataset has a lot of features and many missing values. This gives interesting possibilities for feature transformation and data visualization.

This project focuses on data preparation (feature engineering, dealing with missing values, etc.) and application of linear regression (including Ridge Regression and the Lasso) to predict the sale price of the houses.


## Cab Booking Cancellations

[Cab Booking Cancellations](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-cab-booking-cancellations) uses data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-cab-booking-cancellations). The business problem tackled here is trying to improve customer service for YourCabs.com, a cab company in Bangalore. The problem of interest is booking cancellations by the company due to unavailability of a car. 

The main focus of this project is exploratory data analysis.

## Emergency - 911 Calls

Exploratory Data Analysis of the 911 calls dataset hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert/data).
