This repository is a compilation of data science notebooks I created for self-learning purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

[Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/JuanFargier/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Titanic.ipynb) is a competition from Kaggle and it's a binary classification problem. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model for classifying new passengers as to whether they survived the tragedy or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

This project includes examples of Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Machine Learning algorithms, etc. using Python and its libraries.
